	- loads a message into a queue
	- When the message is loaded a thread 0 specific count increments by 1
	- Thread0 sum is the sum of all the random numbers it sends

	- Each take the message with the random number they recieved and print it over uart
	- Thread1 sum is the sum of the numbers it recieves
	- Shared count is a count of the total messages sent
